# RHDT-cipher
An attempt at hardening a simple double transposition cipher with randomness in preprocessing.

This repository contains a overview and instructions for operating the cipher and a python script that will both encrypt and decrypt using the cipher.
Use online with https://onlinegdb.com/HnNYlOjT0 or download the python code. Code does not require anythong other than Python itself to run.
